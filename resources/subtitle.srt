00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,480
<i> In the basement, other than me, there was one more person? </i>

00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,000
<i>Who is it?</i>

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,790
<i>Just who are you? </i>

7
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,950

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,550
<i>Since a while ago,</i>

19
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,130
<i>I was Mr. Cha's personal doctor.</i>

<i>Episode 10</i>

24
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,150
Where are we going?

25
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm trying to leave here. I can't leave you in Cha Do Hyun's place.

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Mr. Shin! Calm down and listen to me.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,230
Listen to what?

28
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,680
Listen to your warning saying that since you've teamed up with Cha Do Hyun now and am ready to kill me, get prepared?

29
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,500
I told you I don't have that kind of skill.

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,940
I'm just trying to be an equal moderator between Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin, that's all.

31
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,680
Equal moderator?

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,240
Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin both have the need to understand each other!

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,880
This can only end if one of us disappears!

34
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,900
And you must choose only one in the end.

35
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,150
Is it ok with you even if I disappear?

36
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,230
Would you like me to disappear?

37
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,590
Mr. Cha didn't request for me to get rid of you.

38
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,160
He wants to converse with you.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,650
He wants to reconcile with you.

40
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm just a moderator between you two.

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,190
I'm a negotiator. I'm nothing more or less than that.

42
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,260
So the choice is not mine to make.

43
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,420
You've completely fallen for Cha Do Hyun.

44
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,910
Mr. Shin!

45
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,100
Do you think Cha Do Hyun put you here with an innocent intention?

46
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,480
What does that mean?

47
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,870
Do you think that bastard is really

48
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,050
just innocent like that?

49
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,720
What does that mean?

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,630
Check it yourself.

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,740
Where are you trying to go?

52
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,290
Cha Do Hyun broke the rule.

53
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,960
Now, it's impossible to remain at peace with him.

54
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,790
I'm thinking of punishing him in my own way.

55
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,750
Because that's the rule for the game.

56
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,320
Wait! What rule? What punishment?

57
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,880
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,890
Tell me what the rules for the game are.

59
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,340
I said tell me!

60
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,480
Cha Do Hyun has you here as a hostage.

61
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,170
In order to protect his woman, and to threaten me.

62
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,470
And foolishly enough, you're caught right in the trap.

63
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,240
What are you talking about? Explain so I can understand.

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,690
So that's why I'm going to punish him.

65
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:39,480
Since he ruined my world, Cha Do Hyun's world needs to be ruined too.

66
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,790
You! What in the world are you planning to do?

67
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,590
When that bastard comes back,

68
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,270
so that he can never clean up this mess,

69
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,910
so much that he would want to hide again,

70
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,030
so that he would hide and never come back, I'm thinking of punishing him thoroughly.

71
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,740
Wait!

72
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,990
Take me with you.

73
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,360
If you're not going to have me,

74
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,390
don't touch me.

75
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,290

78
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,110

79

<i>Long time, no see, Cha Do Hyun.</i>

80
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,750
<i>While I wasn't here, you've made the house into a complete prison.</i>

81
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,680
<i>It's amazing. Very amazing.</i>

82
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,300
<i>It's a great way to spend your money, just like the rich chaebol you are.</i>

83

<i>If you touch my woman,</i>

86
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,050
<i>your woman will be in danger.</i>

87
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,300
Do you like it?

88
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,390
But what's wrong with your expression?

89
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,620
Don't worry about it. I heard women are usually like this before their engagement.

90
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,720
Never mind.

91
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,220
I understand. And

92
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,040
I was wrong.

93
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,460
I took care of my dignity before your feelings and pride.

94
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,540
I reacted foolishly to a rash rumor. I made you lonely. Shall I continue?

95
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,450
That's enough stop it now. It seems like you're well aware of it.

96
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,830
Aren't you going to try it on?

97
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,400
Here.

98
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,400
It's pretty.

99
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,560
Do you want to drink wine?

100
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,410
No, I have a breakfast meeting tomorrow so I have to wake up early.

101
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,620
Can you give me another cup of tea?

What happened?

107
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,370
First of all, please give me your car keys.

108
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,010
Did you find Se Gi?

109
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,310
- I think I know where he is.<br>-Then I'll- <br> -No.

110
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,780
Just in case Se Gi comes back,

111
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,340
Secretary Ahn, you can stay here.

112
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,110
Mom said she will be on the night flight. She'll arrive at Incheon Airport tomorrow.

113
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,500
-Yes I know.<br>-Do you want to go to the airport or shall I?<br>-Oh, mother said she'll go.

114
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,960
She's excited about meeting her old classmate from high school again.

Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow.

116
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,090
Your lips are a bit red.

117
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,060
Huh?

118
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,550

What are you trying to do? Why'd you call?

121
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,280
Are you trying to maintain your fishery half a step late?

122
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,630
Either way, you picked up my call.

123
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm engaged to Ki Joon. Don't call in the future.

124
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,930
<i>Nice timing, I guess.</i>

125
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,900
- What? <br>-Want to meet up? I missed you.

126
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,360
- I'm busy. I don't have time to meet you. <br>- No way.

127
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,570
Cha Ki Joon just left, so you're probably alone.

128
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,610
Where are you now?

129
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,130

-Are you crazy?<br><i>-Why do you think it's me?</i>

Who's there?

133
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,530
Oppa?

134
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,990
Is it you, Oppa? Did you leave something behind?

135
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,500
Hello.

136
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
You're out of your mind.

137
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,990
I don't think you should treat your guests like this.

138
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,120
You told me if you came for me late at night or called asking to meet up,

139
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,320
and crossed the line that you mustn't cross, you said that's not you so I should avoid you at all costs.

140
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,010
I said that? Wow, that's impressive.

141
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,120
Leave. It's too late.

142
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,080
The engagement ring looks nice.

143
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,000
I wanted to put it on for you.

144
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,040
But you. Don't you think you're going too far ahead?

145
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,940
Who said I'm going to cross the line?

160
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,540
During the few hours you lost me,

161
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,380
you're about to go nuts with curiosity wondering what happened, right?

162
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,280
Is it fun to tease?<br>-I feel like that.

163
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,790
When I'm not here, I go crazy in curiousity of what happened between Cha Do Hyun and you.

164
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,130
So I only imagine with the amount of trust I have in you.

165
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,160
And you betrayed that trust.

166
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:02,280
Let's stop, Mr. Shin. Let's stop it all and just end it here.

167
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,450
What will it take to stop you?

168
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,350
Is your IQ number only one digit? How many times do I have to tell you?

169
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,970
Instead of me, kill Cha Do Hyun.

170
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,500
Vice President.

171
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,170
Secretary Ahn, you've aged, too. Seeing that you don't recognize me at once.

172
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,330
This is quite lonely.

173
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,300
This place is filled with people on Cha Do Hyun's side.

174
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,970
It feels like I was dragged into enemy ground.

175
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,250
Tonight, I will stay here so

176
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,150
Oh Ri Jin, go stay at a hotel-<br>-No, it's okay. I'll stay here.

177
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,920
-We have things to talk about.<br>-Is what they say.

178
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,980
The door is over there.

179
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,810
Mr. Shin! Let's talk.

180
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,770
If you stayed behind hoping for Cha Do Hyun to return, then forget it.

181
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,980
That bastard isn't coming back.

182
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,060
What are you saying?

183
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,040
You didn't hear it?

184
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,370
That bastard is never coming back.

185
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,970
Why? There must be a reason.

186
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,210
-Because the seal to his memory has been opened.<br>-The seal to his memory?

187
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,070
Since the entrance is opened,

188
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,050
the memories he wouldn't want to remember,

189
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,920
will soon get released one by one.

190
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,360
By any chance...do you know about it?

191
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,050
The year's worth of memory that Mr. Cha lost?

192
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,890
Of course.

193
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,170
- Because I was born in order to handle that. <br>- Then...

194
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,520
In the memories that you have that Mr. Cha does not, by chance...

195
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,260
<i> Have you really never met Mr. Cha or Se Gi before? </i>

196
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,020
Am I in it?

197
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,330
Am I...in it?

198
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,700
I'll tell you if you choose me.

199
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,300
-Are you joking!? <br> -Does it seem like I'm joking?

200
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,800
It's the same as you throwing in fake bait to reel in fish!

201
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,480
It's bait that I'm risking my life on.

202
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,300
So eat it. Hook onto it.

203
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,410
Are you the one who's IQ is a single digit?

204
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,260
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't have that kind of potential!

205
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,470
Keep this in mind. The more you hold off your decision,

206
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,630
the more destroyed Cha Do Hyun's world becomes.

207
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,020
I'm going to make it like that.

208
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,520
You understand?

209
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,760
<i> What a charming engagement ring. </i>

210
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,880
<i>I wanted to put one on for you. </i>

211
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:08,480
<i>Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 7-Dimensional Team @ Viki</i>

212
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh Ri Jin, you'll catch a cold if you sleep out here.

213
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,020
Mr. Cha?

214
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,710
Yes, I'm Cha Do Hyun.

215
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,940
You came back?

216
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,210
I was worried because I thought you really wouldn't come back!

217
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,490
When did you come?

218
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,870
Try to stop Mr. Shin.

219
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,670
I'm sorry but I can't take care of him anymore.

220
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,040
Oh Ri Jin.

221
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,030
Yes.

222
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,140
Thank you for all this time.

223
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,800
-We meet again. <br> -What's the reason you're being like this to me?

224
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
Don't be scared.

225
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,860
I'm only here to get my car.

226
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,710
Tomorrow, I'll come to get that car.

227
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,400
Are you okay, President?

228
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,470
Exactly where did he learn how to drive...

229
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,410
<i>Your lips are pretty red. </i>

230
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Wow.

231
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,670
But...but...isn't that the Vice President?

232
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,250
<i> Speechless. <br> Wow. Awesome.</i>

233
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,480
<i> Heart drops. </i>

234
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,980
<i>Uncommonly handsome man<i></i></i>

235
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,520
Hello, Grandfather. No...

236
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,150
Chairman Cha Geon Ho.

237
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,740
You seem well.

238
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,560
He isn't here as well? <br> -Yes...

239
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,790
Then, even at Team Leader Han's house?

240
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,580
Only his car was parked there.

241
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,430
Anyway, let's look around inside the company.

242
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,900
Secretary Choi! Secretary Choi!

243
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,220
Ah, y..yes...

244
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,430
Did you by chance see the Vice President today?

245
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,850
He really looked to die for today!

246
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,180
I mean, I thought he stepped out of a fashion magazine!

247
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,280
<i>It's Shin Se Gi. </i>

248
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,470
So where is he right now?

249
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,260
What are you guys looking at?

250
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,390
Is this the first time you've seen a handsome man yawn?

251
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,610
Vice President, let's step out for a moment...

252
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,620
There's a party tonight, but you've already changed! And even styled your hair to an all-back style.

253
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,690
He sure is diligent!

254
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,510
-Vice President! <br>- Don't touch me.

255
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,400
We won't touch you, yes. Then, just the chair...

256
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,890
What are you doing?

257
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,380
What are you doing? Stop it right now!

258
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
I told you to stop touching me.

259
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,830
How disgustingly high and mighty of you.

260
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,910
Here. I touched you, I touched you. What are you going to do, huh? Huh?

261
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,400
Stop touching me. I told you to stop touching me. Stop, stop, stop touching me. I told you, stop.

262
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,570
What are you doing right now!? We're at the workplace.

263
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,450
I'm sorry. It's just that he won't listen to me.

264
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:37,260
You heard him. This is the workplace and I'm Cha Do Hyun, the Vice President.

265
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,760
And I need to attend the meeting right now.

266
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,690
That's enough. It's too late to stop him.

267
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,220
We have to stop him. Se Gi is thinking of destroying everything Cha Do Hyun worked for.

268
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,850
He already revealed himself to the employees,

269
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,110
and today's meeting is a meeting where the Vice President's attendance is mandatory.

270
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,450
- But... <br>- If an emergency situation occurs, we have no choice but to stop it with our entire bodies.

271
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,660
Just a moment.

272
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,840
Yes, Madame.

273
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,460
Oh Ri Jin?

274
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:39,730
Currently, the 5 member idol group Rocking is showing great sales in the album charts.

275
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,600
They're also working towards international advancements.

276
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,910
Okay, the album team should prepare the presentation for the Asian Music Festival until next week; and now, let's move on to the video team.

277
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,150
Vice President?

278
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,390
Vice President, report.

279
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,560
<i>Oh Ri Jin ♥ Shin Se Gi <br>Oh Ri Jin, you are a star in my heart</i>

280
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,300
<i> Cha Ki Joon = Attention hogger <br>Boring bastard!!</i>

281
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,270
Give that back!

282
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,310
Vice President, what are you doing right now?

283
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,230
Did you find Omega?

284
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,470
Omega?

285
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,700
Do I have to catch a tuna for you now?

286
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,740
What are you trying to say?

287
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,350
Omega's copyrights are secured.

288
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,860
It's the contract directly signed by Omega himself.

289
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,180
If the task is done, shouldn't you be happy?

290
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,280
You worked hard.

291
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,010
This project will return to the original person in charge, Team Leader Lee.

292
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,860
So cheap.

293
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,190
You make the servants work and take in all the money yourself?

294
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,950
Vice President, do you see this meeting as some kind of playground?

295
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,410
There is a time and place for jokes--

296
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,950
Seeing how you can't even differentiate between jokes and disses,

297
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,420
your brain's no good.

298
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,000
What did you just say?

299
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,610
If a person with education has been educated enough, in front of all his employees,

300
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,210
cheaply outcast an opponent like this openly, isn't it embarrassing?

301
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,440
Omega's production will be handled by Team Leader Lee from now on.

302
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,800
That... President... That's...

303
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,590
What is it?

304
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,960
Omega signed the contact

305
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,430
on the condition that only Vice President would handle the production, so...

306
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,720
Is what they say.

307
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,170
<i>Cha Ki Joon.</i>

308
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,590
I prepared some ice cold soda because I thought you might feel heated.

309
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,180
Please leave.

310
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,490
Don't feel too angry.

311
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:59,380
Vice President Cha. I didn't see him like that but he is very cool.

312
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,960
A fellow that's normally like a puppy

313
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,570
but today he was totally like a hyena...kya~

314
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,360
I mean, how can someone change all of a sudden like that?

315
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,410
It isn't like he have multiple personalities or something.

316
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,510
Leave! Can't you hear me? I said LEAVE!

317
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,870
Yes.

318
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,620
I can't understand. I can't understand at all.

319
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,570
How does he stay still

320
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,120
while being treated like this?

321
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,890
How stupid do you have to become for that to become possible?

322
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,400
That's what is called responsibility.

323
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,940
Because there is something to protect, and something to accomplish, that is why he is enduring it.

324
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,540
That is something a person who latched responsibility off of them

325
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,480
can say with such ease.

326
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,040
Is that...about me?

327
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,050
Looking at it now,

328
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:05,490
Secretary Ahn and Cha Do Hyun really are a match made in heaven.

329
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,620
But what to do?

330
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,190
That Cha Do Hyun bastard will never come back.

What are you doing now?

333
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,250
I haven't seen Oh Ri Jin since long before. Where did she go?

334
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,080
She left to meet with Vice President's mother.

335
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,150
Who did you say she's going to meet?

336
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,560
She left after receiving a call from the Vice President's mother.

337
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,540
Are you crazy? What do you expect them to do together?

338
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,360
What are you saying?

339
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,630
They were already acquaintances.

340
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,740
Where did they go?

341
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,490
Where are these two people?!

342
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,300
Why...are you giving this to me?

343
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,700
I bought it for you because I thought it would match you well.

344
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,890
Just trying holding it for now.

345
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,380
I don't have a right to accept things like this.

346
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,710
I said to try holding it.

347
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,550
Yes.

348
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,540
It looks good.

349
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,270
As expected, my eyes are good.

350
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,830
Here.

351
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,530
-Take the tag off. <br>-Yes?

352
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,400
Since it looks good on you, there's no need to do a refund. I said to remove the tag.

353
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,150
Yes.

354
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,360
Since you took the tag off, I'm saying this now. That's a bribe.

355
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,620
Then, I'll put it back.

356
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,530
Don't you know that I can't return it once the tag is removed?

357
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:23,090
Then, what is the consequence for receivng this bribe..?

358
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,630
Is my kid eating well?

359
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,340
Yes.

360
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,620
And do you think he's sleeping well?

361
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,460
<i>Don't go!</i>

362
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,630
<i>Play with me, play with me.</i>

363
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,800
Excuse me, Madame.

364
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,380
I wanted to ask you something.

365
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,960
About what?

366
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,340
It's an off topic question, but

367
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:20,580
I heard he has no memories from when he was seven until he was eight years old.

368
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,710
Is it true?

369
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,770
Who said that?

370
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,170
Did my child say that?

371
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,790
Yes.

372
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,300
So what I'm saying is...

373
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,590
Perhaps, did something happen back then?

374
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,220
There's no such thing. Nothing much happened.

375
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,620
Ah...

376
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,180
Then, by chance, when Vice President was younger,

377
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,290
did he have a close friend his age?

378
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,690
Why are you asking about that?

379
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,570
Yesterday, when he was resting in the dressing room,

380
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,340
he seemed to be having a nightmare.

381
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,220
He kept looking for some kid in his sleep.

382
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,440
Get up!

383
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,180
Do Hyun...

384
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,080
This is a warning.

385
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,100
From now on, you better not call her out.

386
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,140
Do you understand what I'm saying?

387
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,800
Do Hyun...Do Hyun...

388
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,750
Could it be...

389
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,340
that you remembered everything now?

390
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,720
Hold on. I'm not done talking with your mom yet. I have things left to say to her!

391
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,970
There's no need. There's no need to listen to that woman!

392
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,330
Why are you so mad?

393
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,360
I was just being a friend and talking with her.

394
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,130
Whenever someone is lonely, they all want to reveal their pain sometimes.

395
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,260
Pain? Loneliness?

396
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,650
Should I tell you what kind of woman she is?

397
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,240
Should I take off her mask!?

398
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,820
What do you mean mask?

399
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,050
In an abusive scene where one person's soul was getting shattered,

400
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,530
there are three types of people.

401
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,110
Victim, perpetrator, and witness!

402
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,390
Even if there is one less person out of those three, bad things don't happen.

403
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,670
<i>He was...abused?</i>

404
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,630
That woman was a witness.

405
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,830
And she survived in Seungjin Group using that as a weapon.

406
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,090
And even now, she is struggling to exist using that as a threat.

407
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,760
But could I really be able to love that woman?

408
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,190
Answer! I said, answer!

409
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,670
You're doing well.

410
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,970
That's right.

411
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,080
Slowly, go slowly.

412
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,960
That's nice. Good hold.

413
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,980
<i>Since when did you know that I was Cha Do Hyun?</i>

414
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,640
<i>How much and how far do you know about me?</i>

415
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,630
<i>I knew you were the only successor of Seungjin Group from the start.</i>

416
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,080
<i>But why did you pretend not to know?</i>

417
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,810
<i>You knew my name but why did you call me Perry?</i>

418
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,750
<i>Because I figured it was an act or a cover up.</i>

419
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:14,110
<i>The desire to escape from being a third generation chaebol and act as a totally different person.</i>

420
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,810
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

421
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:20,870
<i>But that guy you talked about, does it make sense that he changes drastically every time you meet him?</i>

422
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,450
<i>What if that isn't the strategy of the mind?</i>

423
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,430
<i>What if it's not something done freely, but against his will?</i>

424
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,550
<i>It's not a defense mechanism, but a trap?</i>

425
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,000
<i>Some chaebol asked me to be his secret physician for three months.</i>

426
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,340
<i>Do you like him?</i>

427
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,670
<i>Me? Like who?</i>

428
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,870
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

429
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,010
<i>Excuse me, but where is this plane landing?</i>

430
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,000
<i>About the novel, The Child in the Basement,</i>

431
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,710
<i>what was the reason the boy was afraid of the basement?</i>

432
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,630
<i>No way...</i>

433
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,760
What's up with you? Making mistakes which isn't like you?

434
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,930
Even monkeys fall from the tree sometimes.

435
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,330
You got something, right?

436
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,350
What are you talking about?

437
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,540
Something must have popped into your head while climbing. Tell me.

438
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,340
There's a man.

439
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,490
Why are you telling me so easily today? It's not fun.

440
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,910
Appearance, family, education. On the outside, he has all the points that would make everyone jealous.

441
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,750
But truthfully, he is a man with a mental disability.

442
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,700
Considering him as a main character of a thriller novel, it's a bit plain.

443
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:10,730
Then one day, a woman shows up in his life like a coincidence, like a destiny.

444
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,620
And...

445
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,910
how do you think the story goes from there?

446
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,290
Pack your stuff. We're leaving this place.

447
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,540
Even though you know the memories that Mr. Cha lost,

448
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,530
what's the reason for shutting your mouth?

449
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,160
What in the world is the reason that you're not telling?

450
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,660
That bastard cannot handle it.

451
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,710
In the end, he will end his own life.

452
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,860
But he can handle it. He can overcome it.

453
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,310
Then we die!

454
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,720
We were made to take in that bastard's pain instead, for him.

455
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,280
If that bastard's pains go away, then we all die.

456
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,740
Either he lives like this while covering it up, or instead of him, I remain alive. It's one or the other.

457
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,050
One more thing.

458
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,840
In that memory that Mr. Cha doesn't have,

459
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,100
but in that memory that only you have,

460
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,680
am I in there?

461
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,990
Am I? In there?

462
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,110
Answer me.

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,720
Hey..you..

476
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,100
You..how did you know that?

477
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,870
I understood you lying to your parents, and I also understood that you were alone with a man.

478
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,200
But this is a different story.

479
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:11,690
I can't leave you in harm's way, so listen to your brother.

480
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,480
Are you even her real brother?

481
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,850
Stay right here. What I said earlier wasn't a threat. It was a declaration of war.

482
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,110
Ri On! Oh Ri On..

483
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,900
-Cha Do Hyun?<br>-Let's just say I am.

484
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,490
Why are you kidnapping her? With who's permission?

485
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,720
Are you not Cha Do Hyun?

486
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:05,490
Cha Do Hyun, this bastard. How many people has he been caught by?

487
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,790
-I don't know who you are but I am taking my sister back.<br>-With who's permission?

488
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:17,110
Whatever the penalty is for breaking the contract, I will provide.

489
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,780
With what right?

490
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,880
For further negotiations, I will continue with Cha Do Hyun later.

491
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,940
I'm asking you. With what rights are you taking her?

492
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,250
Rights as a brother.

493
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:44,020
If you continue to claim rights as her brother while having eyes of a man, I'll take your eyeballs out.

494
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,760
Then you yourself have less of a right than me, because you are

495
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:57,900
a son of Seungjin Group.

496
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,100
Hey. What did you tell Mr. Shin?

497
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,680
What did you tell him that makes him look so sad?

498
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,430
Shut your mouth. Are we going to picnic? You're going to get punished right now.

499
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:45,600
♫<i>The deep night shows you who was not able to leave </i>♫

00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,110

[Ssangli]

505
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,790
Tell them so that they don't get shocked and beg for forgiveness no matter what.

506
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:45,040
And tell them you'll stop being his physician right away.

507
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,420
Also,

508
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,180
don't mention his name,

509
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,480
or Seungjin Goup either.

510
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,480
-Why?<br>-Don't ask for reasons!

511
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,980
Just do as your brother tells you to do.

512
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,120
What's wrong with him?

513
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,590
When I first saw Dr. Oh, I knew it right away.

514
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,460
She's definitely worth something!

515
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,620
That's right, that's right.

516
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,010
Dr. Oh.

517
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,000
Professor!

518
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,040
Ri Jin!

519
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,460
Why are you here?

520
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,750
It was like that?

521
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,410
She says that's what happened.

522
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,790
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to lie to you from the beginning.

523
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,430
This girl! How dare you lie about that out of all things to lie about?

524
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,700
I should just-

525
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,790
Mom! Wait a minute!

526
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:51,050
Professor is here too! Can't you save my social dignity a bit too?

527
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,110
You little wench! What good did you do?

528
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,700
I'm sorry but I can't take your side on this.

529
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,620
Everybody, calm down.

530
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,970
Wow, I wondered what Dr. Oh ate as a child to become this strong like a warrior.

531
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,480
I guess it was genetics.

532
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,870
You also knew it, Professor?

533
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,330
That Ri Jin didn't go to America and was hanging around as a physician?

534
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,640
You, really! Why are you being like that to the professor?

535
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,400
There is no way that the professor knew and wouldn't tell us... would you?

536
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,650
I'm sorry.

537
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:23,370
Why didn't you say a word to us until now? You're too much.

538
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
The professor only figured it out yesterday.

539
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,910
And it was me that kicked away a good opportunity that he requested.

540
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:34,750
Hey you. Have we ever belittled and opposed your decisions?

541
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,000
Why didn't you tell us truthfully?

542
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,790
What is family? We cherish, trust, and understand each other, that's what family is.

543
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:45,720
The reason why Dr. Oh couldn't tell you... is so that she could keep the patient's secret.

544
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,330
She did something that she should as a doctor.

545
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,580
I am very embarrassed in front of Dr. Oh.

546
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,890
Professor...

547
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,330
A doctor shouldn't turn a blind eye to a patient who needs his or her help.

548
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:06,180
I convinced her so that she would turn away from the patient and choose studying abroad instead.

549
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:11,540
But even then, Dr. Oh followed her conscience as a doctor and chose the patient.

550
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,000
I learned a lot this time from Dr. Oh.

551
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,540
So please just forgive her now.

552
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,000
Please do me a favor.

553
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,040
<i>There's nothing to forgive.<i></i></i>

554
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,000
Sit down, sit down.

555
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,250
Sit down.

556
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,700
Here...

557
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,540
Welcome back.

558
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,450
<i> What is it that the chaebols are trying to hide? </i>

559
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,550
<i> Disputes amongst the chaebol families and reconcilement. </i>

560
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,760
<i> Seungjin Group's Chairman Cha Geon Ho and his daughter-in-law Min Seo Yeon die in a car crash. </i>

561
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:20,300
So you didn't only live happily up till now.

562
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,950
Seeing..

563
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,950
that your heart has been broken into pieces.

564
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,290
Professor, are you going to eat the sweet potato?

565
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,310
No, its not even cooked all the way yet.

566
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,470
This is good.

567
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:44,120
Uh...have some coffee.

568
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,440
Earlier... thank you, Professor.

569
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,950
It's nothing, in all reality I have some responsibility over this.

570
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,100
From the beginning Mr. Cha was my patient,

571
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,050
but I feel like I put the burden on your shoulders.

572
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:09,000
So I wasn't feeling too well.

573
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,080
I heard from Secretary Ahn

574
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,650
that Mr. Cha isn't coming back.

575
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:21,760
Yes, according to Se Gi, the memory seal broke so he hid.

576
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,160
That most likely he will never come back again.

577
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,060
The seal of the memory broke...

578
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,410
Do you have a gist of what that means?

579
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,970
I really don't know.

580
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,540
But... the last nightmare that Mr. Cha had

581
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:41,100
might be the hook to find what that memory is.

582
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,410
It's only a guess.

583
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,900
I'm worried.

584
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:52,050
If Cha Do Hyun really doesn't come back

585
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:56,030
if he never wakes up...

586
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,950
What should I do?

587
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:03,330
At the same time the memory seal broke,

588
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:06,290
what if there was a negotiation?

589
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:10,330
He might come back as a stronger person.

590
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:14,100
Then, right now, Cha Do Hyun...

591
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,300
Either gets overpowered by Se Gi,

592
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,370
or will come stronger than before. It will be one or the other.

593
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,160
<i>The most important thing is how he will deal with his pain in his past memories.</i>

594
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,830
As of now, all we can do is trust Mr. Cha and wait.

595
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,700
Are you there Cha Do Hyun?

596
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,410
What do you think?

597
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,010
Don't you think it's time you deal with the past?

598
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,330
The people that made you a monster,

599
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,770
you can't just leave them be, can you?

600
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,540
What do you want to do?

601
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,810
I'll do it? No... or You?

602
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,950
If you want to do it, come out.

603
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,040
You can't?

604
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,250
If you want to stop me, then come out.

605
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,000
You can't, can you?

606
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,370
Then just stay there crumpled like that and never come back out!

607
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:16,570
Either way,

608
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:20,300
a world that's hard for you to handle will be created.

609
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,040
Long time, no see, Grandma.

610
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,450
What are you trying to do?

611
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,220
Like a night robber, making no sound.

612
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,040
All I did was follow what you told me to do.

613
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,120
You seem very surprised.

614
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,870
What are you saying?

615
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:04,980
You said to live quietly as if I wasn't here.

616
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,660
And if I can, not to appear in others' sight.

617
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,080
What I saw, or heard, or experienced...

618
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,290
as if I have nothing, quietly.

619
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,580
You don't remember?

620
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,540
You!

621
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,350
Why?

622
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:35,830
You thought that I lost all of my childhood memories.

623
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,590
Are you surprised?

624
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:43,350
I wonder why everyone believes that I lost my memories?

625
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,970
As if they hope for me to.

626
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,950
What do you want to say?

627
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,830
Seungjin Group, give it to me, Grandmother.

628
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,540
What? Give you what?

629
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,500
Seungjin Group...

630
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,000
Did you hold hands with your mother?

631
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,700
Did you go on the same side as her and decide to threaten me together?

632
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,830
Rather than a threat, it's a request.

633
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,660
If you feel fear when asked of a request,

634
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,930
that's what a threat is.

635
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,480
Because fear is something you make yourself.

636
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,760
Leave now.

637
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,160
Before others wake up.

638
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,870
You must still

639
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,950
be waiting for father to wake up.

640
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,950
Have you still not let go of him yet?

641
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:33,250
How dare you... How dare you!

642
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,500
That lingering affection...

643
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,460
shall I end it for you?

644
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,580
Shall I end it for you?

645
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,640
Hello, Cha Joon Pyo.

646
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,530
No, I will just call you father.

647
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,160
It doesn't seem you were that well.

648
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,030
So that time,

649
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,660
you shouldn't have saved me.

650
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,450
The reason I became a monster, is probably because of you.

651
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,110
I...

652
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:02,500
should now let you rest in peace.

653
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,580
<i>Why did you disturb me?</i>

654
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,500
<i>Do you know how hard it was for me?</i>

655
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,660
<i>Our father..</i>

656
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:49,160
